# AIUCD 2021 proposal
Documented step-by-step conversion from dictionary of symbols to turtle descriptions of wikidata paintings.

All the algorithms are available in the jupyter file [SymbAlgorithmCommented.ipynb](https://github.com/br0ast/symbolisminKGexperiment/blob/main/SymbAlgorithmCommented.ipynb) along with the input file for the automatic encoding of symbolic information [Allegory.tsv](https://github.com/br0ast/symbolisminKGexperiment/blob/main/Allegory.tsv)

The expected results are included in the folder [Expected Results](https://github.com/br0ast/symbolisminKGexperiment/tree/main/Expected%20results)

For more information about this experiment, check our [poster](https://github.com/br0ast/symbolisminKGexperiment/blob/main/posterfinal.pdf) or our [full submission](https://aiucd2021.labcd.unipi.it/book-of-abstracts/) (page 572) for the [AIUCD Conference](https://aiucd2021.labcd.unipi.it/)
